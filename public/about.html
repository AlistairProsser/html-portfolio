<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Alistair Prosser. I am a former design engineer and physics teacher who has
  been independantly learning software engineering through Udemy.com with an aim to eventtually become a full stack developer. 
  I have several friends who are also developers and have found it a very interesting and enjoyable challenge to 
  start learning coding and website design from scratch.
</p>

<p>On completion of my current course my aim is to start as a Junior Developer and work my way up to
  eventually becoming a senior full stack developer. I am excited about a career in software engineering
  as I believe that it is a future-proof job with unlimited potential.
</p>

<p>Please feel free to browse this website and look at the example projects that I have completed so far.
  I aim to complete the course by August 2025. If you feel that I have the required skillset for a junior role
  within your company, then please dont hesitate to get in touch using my contact page.
